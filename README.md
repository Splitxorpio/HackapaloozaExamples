Explodes your tabs at Midnight
‚ú® As @backlon says, Friday is "that day." All your tabs self-destruct at midnight. Only with this chrome extension, that actually happens, and with a cool explosion too...

With TabExplosion, your tabs implode when the clock strikes 12. You will never have to deal with dozens of pages of tabs ever again. Increase your productivity, and start each day fresh with a blank browser. You can decide which day you want to blow up your browser (by default every Friday), or even schedule it daily for the hardcore web-surfer.
